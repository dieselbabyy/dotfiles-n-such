# Dotfiles n' Such 

 _Various configuration files - likely of no interest to anyone but myself_ 

 Including, but not limited to (plans on further expanding this as I get around to it):
 - bashrc configuration file (for ease-of-setup with new linux OS installs) 
 - public keys used for authentication 
 - public PGP keys for anyone interested in contacting me via encrypted means 
 - cute lil random shell scripts I've written over the years, including my customized MOTD script, a modified fork of [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) that looks super snazzy upon logging in via SSH 
 
 To be added: 
 - assorted linux customization/configuration files 
 - different preferences json files for various apps 
 - windows terminal customization files/color themes
 - onetab plugin settings
 - more when I think of them lol ðŸ˜ƒ
